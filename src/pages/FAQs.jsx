          question: "How does Aether Soul understand my emotions?",
          answer: "Aether Soul uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze voice tone, facial expressions, body language, and behavioral patterns. It learns your unique emotional patterns over time through machine learning, allowing it to provide increasingly personalized support and responses tailored to your specific needs."
        },
        {
          question: "What makes Aether Soul different from other AI assistants?",
          answer: "Unlike traditional AI assistants that focus on tasks and commands, Aether Soul is specifically designed for emotional support and companionship. It prioritizes empathy, emotional intelligence, and building meaningful relationships rather than just providing information or controlling devices."
        },
        {
          question: "Can Aether Soul work with my smart home devices?",
          answer: "Yes, the Pro model integrates seamlessly with most popular smart home systems including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, and many IoT devices.

        },
        {
          question: "Does Aether Soul record conversations?",
          answer: "Aether Soul only processes conversations in real-time for immediate response. No audio recordings are stored permanently unless you specifically enable the memory feature for learning purposes. Even then, only processed emotional patterns are saved, not actual audio files."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I control what data Aether Soul collects?",
          answer: "Yes, you have full control over data collection through the mobile app. You can choose what types of interactions to remember, set privacy levels for different family members, and completely disable data collection while still maintaining basic functionality."
